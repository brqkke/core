    <h3>What is Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) and how does it work?</h3>
    <p>
      Bitcoin's exchange rate can fluctuate a lot. DCA is a simple,
      beginner-friendly saving strategy helping you minimise short-term
      volatility. By making small & regularly scheduled savings over a longer
      period of time, you can reduce the emotional stress of price volatility,
      reach the best average price per BTC, and maximise your returns.{" "}

    <h3>What is Bitcoin? Why do I want to hold some?</h3>

    <p>
      You don't buy Bitcoin to "get rich quick", but rather to avoid becoming
      poor slowly... With inflation, the buying power of your cash savings is
      melting away every month. For example, 100 US$ a century ago is worth only
      3.5 $ today. Similarly, the Euro has lost almost a third of its buying
      power in only 20 years. Due to inflation, today's Swiss household would
      have to spend over 400 CHF today to buy the same basket they would buy
      with 100 francs in 1961. Bitcoin is a mathematically proven scarce asset,
      as there will only ever be 21 million BTC in circulation. There is no
      central bank or company who can decide to create more. As more people are
      becoming interested in Bitcoin, they will need to share this finite
      amount. Buying some fractions of Bitcoin today is like investing in a bit
      of real estate of this new world for the future.

    <h3>What is a satoshi? What does "stacking sats" mean?</h3>

    <p>
      The same way a euro can be divided into 100 cents, a bitcoin can be
      divided into 100,000,000 units called "satoshis" (as a reference to the
      pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin. Accumulating small amounts of satoshis
      (rather than trying to time the market or trading) is the humble and
      efficient way to save into Bitcoin, and is referred to as "stacking sats".

    <h3>How do I start?</h3>
